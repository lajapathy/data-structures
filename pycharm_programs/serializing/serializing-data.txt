serializing means converting a python object(list,dict, etc.,) to a series of characters, in
such a way that the object can be built back from this series of characters

Ex: pickling, Json

Why JSON is better than pickling ?

1. JSON storage is human readable
2. Pickle is Python-specific. In fact, by default, the bytes generated by Python 3â€™s pickle
cannot be read by a Python 2.x application! JSON can be read by virtually any programming language
